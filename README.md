Dockerize the Java applications:
Create a Dockerfile for each application, 
specifying the base image, copying the application files, and exposing the ports.
Build the Docker images using the docker build command and tag them with appropriate names and versions.
Push the Docker images to a container registry:
Create an account on a container registry like Docker Hub or Google Container Registry.
Tag the Docker images with the registry URL and repository name.
Push the images to the registry using the docker push command.
Deploy the applications with Kubernetes:
Create a Kubernetes deployment manifest for each application, specifying the Docker image, container ports, and resource requirements.
Apply the deployment manifest using the kubectl apply command to create the Kubernetes deployments and pods.
Create a Kubernetes service for each application, exposing the deployment as a service with a stable IP address and port.
Optionally, create an ingress resource to route traffic from the external network to the services.
